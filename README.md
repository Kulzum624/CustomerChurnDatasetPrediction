# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction 📊💡

This project was completed as part of a Data Science & Machine Learning internship. It involves end-to-end analysis and modeling to predict customer churn based on demographic and service usage data.

## 📌 Objectives:
- Understand patterns of customer churn
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Segment high-value customers and analyze churn trends
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models
- Recommend business actions based on insights

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SMOTE (for imbalance handling)

## 🧠 ML Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning)
- XGBoost
- Random Forest with SMOTE & class weight adjustment

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## 🔍 Key Insights:
- Churn was most common among Month-to-Month contract users
- High Monthly Charges + low tenure = higher churn risk
- Adjusted models improved churn detection, especially after using SMOTE

## 📁 Files Included:
- `customer_churn_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all code and explanations
- `churn_data.csv` – Dataset
- Results summary and visualizations
